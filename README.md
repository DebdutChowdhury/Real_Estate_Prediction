# Real Estate Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Real Estate project where data visualization and prediction were performed using Python, data integration was done using SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), and visualization was conducted using PowerBI.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to analyze real estate data to derive insights and make predictions. We utilized various tools and technologies for different stages of the project:

- **Data Visualization and Prediction**:
  - Python was used for data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
  - Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn were employed for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.
  
- **Data Integration**:
  - SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) was utilized for data integration tasks, such as extracting data from various sources, transforming it, and loading it into a data warehouse or destination.
  
- **Visualization**:
  - PowerBI was chosen for its powerful visualization capabilities, allowing for the creation of interactive and insightful dashboards and reports.
